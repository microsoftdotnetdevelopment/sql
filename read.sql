-- GROUP BY column_name;

-- How to group data and use aggregates
-- SELECT <Column List>, <Aggregate Function>(<Column Name>)

-- The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only different values.
-- SELECT DISTINCT column_name,column_name
-- FROM table_name;

Select distinct city from customers;

Select distinct firstname from customers;

-- The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
-- SELECT column_name,column_name
-- FROM table_name
-- WHERE column_name operator value;
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';
-- There are many operators that we also use here-
-- =	Equal
-- !=	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
-- >	Greater than
-- <	Less than
-- >=	Greater than or equal
-- <=	Less than or equal
-- BETWEEN	Between an inclusive range
-- LIKE	Search for a pattern
-- IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column

-- Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields
-- SQL requires single quotes around text values and in numeric fields no quotes are required.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

-- The SQL AND & OR Operators-
-- The AND operator displays a record if both the first condition AND the second condition are true.
-- The OR operator displays a record if either the first condition OR the second condition is true.

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
AND (City='Berlin' OR City='MÃ¼nchen');
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
AND City='Berlin';

-- The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set. In this it set the data in ascending order.
-- SELECT column_name, column_name
-- FROM table_name
-- ORDER BY column_name;
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country;
-- It give all country names in ascending order.

-- ORDER BY DESC -
-- The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted DESCENDING by the "Country" column:
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country DESC;
-- This give results in descending order.
-- ORDER BY Several Columns Example
-- The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column:
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;

-- Desc order-
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

-- The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
-- The SELECT TOP clause can be very useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact on performance.
-- SQL SELECT TOP Equivalent in MySQL and Oracle
-- MySQL Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;

SELECT *
FROM Persons
LIMIT 5;
-- Oracle Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= number;

SELECT *
FROM Persons
WHERE ROWNUM <=5;

-- The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
-- SELECT column_name(s)
-- FROM table_name
-- WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 's%';
-- IN THIS IT GIVE the string that is started with s.
-- In this it give string that is end with s.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE ADDRESS LIKE 'e%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%s';
-- The following SQL statement selects all customers with a Country containing the pattern "land":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country LIKE '%land%';
-- Using the NOT keyword allows you to select records that do NOT match the pattern.
-- The following SQL statement selects all customers with Country NOT containing the pattern "land":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT LIKE '%land%';

-- SQL Wildcard Property-
-- In this we select any string from table.

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '_erlin';
-- By this command it selects all customers with a City starting with any character, followed by "erlin".
-- Next is
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';
-- This SQL statement selects all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p":
-- We can also use this
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%';
-- It selects all customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c".
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';
-- or
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
-- This SQL statement selects all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p":

-- The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
-- SELECT column_name(s)
-- FROM table_name
-- WHERE column_name IN (value1,value2,...);
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City IN ('Paris','London');

-- The BETWEEN operator is used to select values within a range.The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
-- SELECT column_name(s)
-- FROM table_name
-- WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

-- The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20:

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

-- To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

-- The following SQL statement selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20, but products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3 should not be displayed:
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE (Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20)
AND NOT CategoryID IN (1,2,3);

-- BETWEEN Operator with Text Value Example-
-- The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName beginning with any of the letter BETWEEN 'C' and 'M':

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'C' AND 'M';

-- NOT BETWEEN Operator with Text Value Example-
-- The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName beginning with any of the letter NOT BETWEEN 'C' and 'M':

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName NOT BETWEEN 'C' AND 'M';

-- SQL aliases are used to temporarily rename a table or a column heading.

-- SELECT column_name AS alias_name
-- FROM table_name;
-- SQL Alias Syntax for Tables
-- SELECT column_name(s)
-- FROM table_name AS alias_name;

SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers;
SELECT CustomerName, Address+', '+City+', '+PostalCode+', '+Country AS Address
FROM Customers;
-- In this it create temporary column Address that contains a address,city,postal code,country.

-- keep remember the typing here
SELECT firstname, Address+', '+firstname AS fulldetails
FROM Customers;

-- SQL Joins-
-- IN this operation we join the two tables.In these two table atleast one column name is need to be same.
-- There are four types if join-
-- INNER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
-- LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
-- RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
-- FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables

-- A.Inner Joins(Equi join)-only matching rows retrieved no null rows retrieved here
-- B.Outer Joins
-- i.Left Outer Join-it includs null considr the first or left table
-- ii.Right Outer Join-consider right table and compare t totally 
-- iii. Full outer
-- C.Cross Joins-no on clause and prints cartesisan product table records 10*4=40 record
-- D.Self Joins-join table itself
-- E.Equi Joins

-- Both UNION and UNION ALL is used to select information from structurally similar tables. That means corresponding columns specified in the union should have same data type. For example, in the above query, if FIRST_NAME is DOUBLE and LAST_NAME is STRING above query wont work. Since the data type of both the columns are VARCHAR, union is made possible. Difference between UNION and UNION ALL is that , UNION query return only distinct values. 

-- SQL Functions
-- SQL has many built-in functions for performing calculations on data.

-- SQL aggregate functions return a single value, calculated from values in a column.
-- AVG() - Returns the average value of a numeric column
-- COUNT() - Returns the number of rows
-- FIRST() - Returns the first value of the selected column.
-- LAST() - Returns the last value of the selected column.
-- MAX() - Returns the largest value of the selected column.
-- MIN() - Returns the smallest value of the selected column.
-- SUM() - function returns the total sum of a numeric column.

-- SQL scalar functions return a single value, based on the input value.
-- UCASE() - Converts a field to upper case 
-- LCASE() - Converts a field to lower case 
-- MID() - Extract characters from a text field
-- LEN() - Returns the length of a text field 
-- ROUND() - Rounds a numeric field to the number of decimals specified 
-- NOW() - Returns the current system date and time 
-- FORMAT() - Formats how a field is to be displayed
